# Plutus Escrow Contract
## Our entry for WyoHackathon 2019!

Our Plutus escrow smart contract offers the full functionality and security of a traditional escrow service. The buyer's assets are held on the Cardano blockchain and distributed based on a 2-of-3 multi-signature approval system. Parties involved in the contract may easily approve or dispute the fulfillment of the smart contract's terms. In the case of a disagreement between buyer and seller, the escrow agent may determine to which party the funds are distributed.

Our approach utilizes the pure nature of Plutus/PlutusTX and Cardano for simple and reliable communication between client and on-chain code. This enables users to seamlessly interact with the contract, and ensures correct and secure distribution of assets. The implementation is fully tested and functions successfully on the emulated Cardano blockchain.
